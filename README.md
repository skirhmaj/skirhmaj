# Batman Comic Generator

This antiquated codebase represents a PHP application I wrote maybe ten years ago. At first it was hosted at **batmancomic.info** and was later moved to **thomashunter.name/batman**. For ten or so years it was the leading search result when looking for "Batman Comic Generator". Indeed here are the result as I write this:

However it became too much of a chore to maintain. So, I'm finally open sourcing it and killing off the page.

At the height of its career the page would be requested hundreds of times a day. Now it's requested about 25 times per day.
